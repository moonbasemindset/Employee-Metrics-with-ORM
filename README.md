# Employee-Metrics-with-ORM
Using ORM to pull from a database and calculate employee metrics.

This code uses SQL Alchemy with SQLite3 to interact with the Northwind sample database: https://github.com/jpwhite3/northwind-SQLite3

After pulling and combining data about sales from different tables, various metrics related to each employee's sales history are found. These are then exported into an easily readable spreadsheet using the Pandas library.
